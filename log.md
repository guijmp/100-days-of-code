# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: June 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Preparing for the 100 days challenge:
    - Learned some hotkeys in VS Code
    - Started the VIM tutorial and did it until lesson 3.3
    - Created a Twitter and Instagram account.

**Thoughts:**

I do not have a CS degree, so there is a lot of background knowledge that I lack. However, I am excited to be starting this challenge.

## Day 1: June 4, 2022

**Progress:** Started debugging the calculator program

**Thoughts:** I took way too much time to refresh my memory on what the program is doing and figuring out the cause of some errors. Of course this is all explained in the book but I am trying to follow along with as little help as possible.

## Day 2: June 4, 2022

**Progress:** Cleaned up the code and restructured, started introducing feature of keep calculator running even after an error is displayed.

**Thoughts:** I kept checking the book to make sure I got the exercise right. Following along by coding definitely makes me understand the issues that he raises along the way. I am feeling good about my progress, today's lesson: When whithin handling error exception, check for functions that could raise another error, becasue this would be caught by any external error handler.

## Day 3: June 5, 2022

**Progress:** Finalized treatment of errors in multiple statements. Now calculator does not close when an error is found, it refreshes its state to receive next input. Found out a strange behaviour when multiple operators are used eg. 1+++2;

**Thoughts:** I was quite concentrated today, but I got stuck because I didn't realize that I was compiling to a file with a slighlty different name, so I was running the same file over and over again and wondering why my changes were not working haha.
