# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: June 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Preparing for the 100 days challenge:
    - Learned some hotkeys in VS Code
    - Started the VIM tutorial and did it until lesson 3.3
    - Created a Twitter and Instagram account.

**Thoughts:**

I do not have a CS degree, so there is a lot of background knowledge that I lack. However, I am excited to be starting this challenge.
