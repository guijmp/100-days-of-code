# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: June 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Preparing for the 100 days challenge:
    - Learned some hotkeys in VS Code
    - Started the VIM tutorial and did it until lesson 3.3
    - Created a Twitter and Instagram account.

**Thoughts:**

I do not have a CS degree, so there is a lot of background knowledge that I lack. However, I am excited to be starting this challenge.

## Day 1: June 4, 2022

**Progress:** Started debugging the calculator program

**Thoughts:** I took way too much time to refresh my memory on what the program is doing and figuring out the cause of some errors. Of course this is all explained in the book but I am trying to follow along with as little help as possible.
