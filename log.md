# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: June 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Preparing for the 100 days challenge:
    - Learned hotkeys in VS Code
    - Did the VIM tutorial and started using it on VS Code
    - Created a Twitter and Instagram account, sorted out my Discord account

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
