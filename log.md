# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: June 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Preparing for the 100 days challenge:
    - Learned some hotkeys in VS Code
    - Started the VIM tutorial and did it until lesson 3.3
    - Created a Twitter and Instagram account.

**Thoughts:**

I do not have a CS degree, so there is a lot of background knowledge that I lack. However, I am excited to be starting this challenge.

## Day 1: June 4, 2022

**Progress:** Started debugging the calculator program

**Thoughts:** I took way too much time to refresh my memory on what the program is doing and figuring out the cause of some errors. Of course this is all explained in the book but I am trying to follow along with as little help as possible.

## Day 2: June 4, 2022

**Progress:** Cleaned up the code and restructured, started introducing feature of keep calculator running even after an error is displayed.

**Thoughts:** I kept checking the book to make sure I got the exercise right. Following along by coding definitely makes me understand the issues that he raises along the way. I am feeling good about my progress, today's lesson: When whithin handling error exception, check for functions that could raise another error, becasue this would be caught by any external error handler.

## Day 3: June 5, 2022

**Progress:** Finalized treatment of errors in multiple statements. Now calculator does not close when an error is found, it refreshes its state to receive next input. Found out a strange behaviour when multiple operators are used eg. 1+++2;

**Thoughts:** I was quite concentrated today, but I got stuck because I didn't realize that I was compiling to a file with a slighlty different name, so I was running the same file over and over again and wondering why my changes were not working haha.

## Day 4: June 6, 2022

**Progress:** Started implementation of a new feature to the calculator: user defined variables.

**Thoughts:** The use of Tokens to allow for a stram with different types was very enlightning. I managed to spend some time reading and going through the book implementation but also started implementing it by myself without checking the book. I am happy with today's progress.

## Day 5: June 8, 2022

**Progress:** Finished writing changes to introduce the new feature, but now compiler is having trouble with the constructors that I used.

**Thoughts:** Today I did not check the Book, so I am cureious to see how I fared once I deal with the compilation errors. I am happy with today's progress

## Day 6: June 9, 2022

**Progress:** Setting variables inside main function seems to be working but user defined variables needs debugging.

**Thoughts:** I was a bit tired today so I wasn't very productive. Git bash stoped running excutable file so got stuck with that for a while.

## Day 7: June 10, 2022

**Progress:** Put some cout statements in critical parts to try to debugg the code.

**Thoughts:** I was not paying a lot of attention today and I haven't managed to figure out why the code is not working. On the other hand, the current behaviour is very strange so I am really curious as to what is happening.

## Day 8: June 11, 2022

**Progress:** Found out reason for odd behaviour was just good functioning of the program. It seems to be working now, but needs further testing

**Thoughts:** I was getting confuseed because I wasn't mentally following the program from the beggining. Pro tip: when in doubt, start from the beggining!

## Day 9: June 12, 2022

**Progress:** Removed unecessary cout statements. Tested calculator with weird inputs. Implemented a function for the sqrt.

**Thoughts:** Although today was a crazy day (coming back from a camping trip!) I am very happy that I sat down and still managed to be productive with the code today.

## Day 10: June 13, 2022

**Progress:** Implemented function for power, modified quit and let keyworkds.

**Thoughts:** Today was also good progress, but I am getting a bit tired of this calculator project, as it is dragging for a bit. Luckily, only a few last modifications are sugested at the end of chpt. 7 so hopefully I will be done with this calculator in one week.

## Day 11: June 14, 2022

**Progress:** Variable names can now contain underscores, started adding assignment feature to change values of stored variables.

**Thoughts:** Today was good progress, I was very focused and the hour went by quickly. I think I am very close to getting the assignment of variables right, so it should be straight forward to do that tomorrow.
